<h2>Principles to Achieving an Energy Efficient Home</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Orientation of building is a </li>
    <li>Creating a well insulated tight Building envelope with almost no air gaps is the most important. Air tight Insulated
        roof is very important consideration as hot air rises it wants to be trapped in winter then in summer the outer surface
        is heated up by the sun so you want to reduce thermal bridging and any heat transfer into the room below, reducing
        air leaks must be a considered important . External walls, windows and doors want to be able to do the same just
        to a and floor reducing air gaps and thermal bridging through conductive materials. Windows and doors reduce air
        gaps and thermal bridging.All places of intersections and joins sealed.</li>
    <li>Thermal mass contained inside the </li>
    <li>HRV Heat recovery ventilator Once air exchange between external and internal environments is controlled the unit controls
        fresh air coming in and stale air taken out and retrieves the heat which was created in the building.</li>
    <li>Split systems are very efficient way to heat and cool a building. Once the structure is created it is the most efficient
        and cost effective way to save on energy and money. Your dollars will be more effective creating an insulated air
        tight structure and controlling air temperature this form of building reduces energy requirements first without spending
        large amounts on other forms that require large amounts of energy to manufacture and have a short life span where
        as the structure can last a life time and have a short energy payback. Panels create super strong, superior insulated,
        air tight structure,faster build times, flat pack transportable any where, easy assembly, contemporary and stylish
        buildings. studios, One two three bedroom homes can be suited to a number of different situations that create a very
        comfortable accommodation to enjoy living in that you wont want to leave,</li>
    <li>Heat pumps are a fantastic way to efficiently heat your hot water.</li>
    <li>Battery storage of power is now becoming a option that works well I think buying off peak renewable energy is a good
        option.</li>
