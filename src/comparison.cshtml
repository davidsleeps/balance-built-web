                and rigid insulation.

            <td>Standard construction you are framing, insulating, external cladding and plastering internal walls. Traditional
                frame work uses cross bracing then infill the frame with insulation that can sag and move creating gaps that
                result in energy loss.

They are also contain absolutely no asbestos. Panels are pre-cut so as to reduce labour costs on site. All panels are labelled so as to simplify the build process.
